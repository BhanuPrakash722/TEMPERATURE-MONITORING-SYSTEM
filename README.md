# DESCRIPTION
The Temperature Monitoring System utilizes a combination of hardware and software tools for efficient design and implementation. The hardware includes an 8051 microcontroller, which processes data from a temperature sensor like the LM35, and an ADC (if required) to convert the sensor's analog voltage to digital. The temperature readings are displayed on a 16x2 LCD, controlled via data and control pins from the microcontroller. Supporting components such as a power supply, resistors, capacitors, and a breadboard for prototyping are also essential. Software tools include the Keil ÂµVision IDE for writing and compiling Embedded C code, and the Proteus Design Suite for simulating the circuit before physical assembly. Additional tools like a flash programmer upload the firmware onto the microcontroller, while a multimeter and oscilloscope aid in hardware testing and debugging. Together, these tools enable seamless integration of the sensor, microcontroller, and display, ensuring real-time temperature monitoring. This setup is cost-effective, scalable, and ideal for applications like environmental monitoring, industrial control, and educational purposes.
